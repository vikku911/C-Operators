# C-Operators
In programming, an operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable.

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while - is an operator used for subtraction.

Operators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:

1.Arithmetic Operators: 
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data.

2.Assignment Operators: 
In C++, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

3.Relational Operators: 
A relational operator is used to check the relationship between two operands. 

4.Logical Operators: 
Logical operators are used to check whether an expression is true or false. If the expression is true, it returns 1 whereas if the expression is false, it returns 0.

5.Bitwise Operators: 
In C++, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits. They can only be used alongside char and int data types.

6.Other Operators: 
Here's a list of some other common operators available in C++. We will learn about them in later tutorials.
